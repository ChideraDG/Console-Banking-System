In the `BVN` (Bank Verification Number) class of a bank app, you might consider building the following types of methods:

1. **Register BVN**: Method to register a new Bank Verification Number for a user, capturing their personal information and biometric data.

2. **Verify BVN**: Method to verify the authenticity of a BVN, validating it against the central database or authority to ensure it is valid and active.

3. **Update BVN Information**: Method to update the information associated with a BVN, such as personal details or biometric data, ensuring the data remains accurate and up-to-date.

4. **Link BVN to Account**: Method to link a BVN to a user's bank account, enabling seamless identification and verification during account-related transactions.

5. **Get BVN Information**: Method to retrieve information associated with a BVN, including personal details, linked accounts, and verification status.

6. **Deactivate BVN**: Method to deactivate or suspend a BVN, typically in cases of fraud, identity theft, or other security concerns.

7. **Re-activate BVN**: Method to re-activate a previously deactivated BVN, once any issues or concerns have been resolved and the BVN is deemed valid again.

8. **Delete BVN**: Method to permanently delete a BVN record from the system, typically in cases where the BVN is no longer required or has been replaced.

9. **Generate BVN Report**: Method to generate a report of BVN-related activities and statistics, such as registration trends, verification success rates, and compliance metrics.

10. **Search BVN**: Method to search for BVNs based on specific criteria, such as personal information or verification status, facilitating efficient retrieval of BVN records.

11. **Audit BVN Activities**: Method to log and track all activities related to BVNs, including registrations, verifications, updates, and deletions, for auditing and compliance purposes.

12. **Validate Biometric Data**: Method to validate biometric data associated with a BVN, ensuring that it matches the stored data and meets quality standards for identification purposes.

13. **Encrypt BVN Data**: Method to encrypt sensitive BVN data, such as personal information and biometric data, to ensure confidentiality and protect against unauthorized access.

14. **Authenticate BVN**: Method to authenticate the identity of a user based on their BVN, verifying their identity during account-related transactions or authentication processes.

These methods provide the functionality needed to manage Bank Verification Numbers within the bank app, facilitating secure and reliable identification and verification of users.
