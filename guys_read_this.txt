You guys, in the readme memo, in transaction class, attributes,
we have 'authorization code', isn't that the same as the token we spoke about yesterday?

Yeah I think so

dera.
AK I have added the time stuff you spoke about yesterday


Dera, the transaction class depends on the account class. If maybe you can signify the account type in the account file
and also the transaction type(i.e withdraw, transfer etc.)

I instantiated the account type but the transaction type comes from the method in account. So if the user selects deposit,
the transaction_type in your transaction class will become equals to deposit. same thing goes with the other transaction methods

Chidera, I want to start working on the bank class,
my idea with the 'open account' method is to ask for the user's bvn, what do you think?
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Ak.
chidera you want to start working on the bank class, isn't that my line?
also i was thinking the same thing, to open an account you will need the user's bvn

Dera.
Ak. I'm working on users and I have the instance attributes for every user. Also, one of my methods is registering a user.
That's why I started working on it. You have the method to open an account, but no instance concerning a user, so you
are probably a channel to me but not the main person to open the account.

Dozie.
alright then.
